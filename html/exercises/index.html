    <p>One website I would like to build would showcase the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). 
      The website would have an interactive IPA chart. To the right on the screen would be a sidebar that would 
      showcase the IPA symbol for the user. When a user clicks on a symbol, a video is displayed in the sidebar 
      of a person pronouncing the symbol. Underneath the video (but still in the sidebar) would be a complete 
      phonetic description of the sound (consonant/vowel, pulmonic/non-pulmonic, place of articulation, 
      voiced/unvoiced, etc). There would also be a list of a few languages that have been documented to use the 
      sound, which would be hyperlinked to the corresponding page in the Ethnologue. It would be really cool to 
      provide an example word from a language that uses the sound, in the form of the IPA transcription of the 
      word, the native language script transcription of the word (if it exists), and the English translation of 
      the word. When a user clicks on the IPA transcription there is an audio recording of someone reading the 
      word that plays. One other feature that would be nice for it to have would be for a user to be able to 
      type in a word in IPA, and the computer pronounce the newly transcribed word. I think this would be a fun 
      website to build! And who knows, it may even help a linguist out somewhere!
